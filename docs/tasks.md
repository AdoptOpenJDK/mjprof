# mjprof Improvement Tasks

This document contains a detailed list of actionable improvement tasks for the mjprof project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Code Quality Improvements

1. [ ] Improve error handling in MJProf.java as noted in the TODO comment (line 317)
2. [x] Replace string concatenation with StringBuilder in StackFrame.java (line 64)
3. [ ] Implement the TODO in StepInfo.java to properly check if a class is assignable from BasePlugin
4. [ ] Add proper exception handling with meaningful error messages instead of printing to stderr
5. [ ] Refactor the command-line parsing logic in MJProf.java to improve readability and maintainability
6. [ ] Remove commented-out code in PluginTest.java and other files
7. [ ] Add null checks and validation for input parameters in plugin constructors
8. [ ] Standardize coding style across the codebase (indentation, naming conventions, etc.)
9. [ ] Use try-with-resources for all resource management to prevent leaks
10. [ ] Replace static initialization blocks with proper initialization methods where appropriate

## Architecture Improvements

1. [ ] Refactor the plugin system to use a more modern dependency injection framework
2. [ ] Implement a proper logging framework instead of using System.out.println for debugging
3. [ ] Separate the command-line interface from the core functionality to improve testability
4. [ ] Create interfaces for all major components to improve modularity and testability
5. [ ] Implement a configuration system to allow customization without code changes
6. [ ] Refactor the plumbing system to use a more standard pipeline pattern
7. [ ] Improve the plugin discovery mechanism to be more robust and efficient
8. [ ] Create a proper error handling strategy with custom exceptions
9. [ ] Implement a caching mechanism for frequently used thread dump data
10. [ ] Refactor the StepsRepository to use a more efficient data structure for step lookup

## Testing Improvements

1. [ ] Increase test coverage for the main class (MJProf.java)
2. [ ] Add integration tests for the end-to-end workflow
3. [ ] Implement tests for the commented-out test cases in PluginTest.java
4. [ ] Add tests for error handling and edge cases
5. [ ] Implement property-based testing for the command-line parser
6. [ ] Add performance tests for large thread dumps
7. [ ] Implement tests for all plugin types (currently some are missing)
8. [ ] Add tests for the plumbing system
9. [ ] Implement tests for the plugin discovery mechanism
10. [ ] Add tests for the macros system

## Documentation Improvements

1. [ ] Add Javadoc comments to all public classes and methods
2. [ ] Create a developer guide explaining the architecture and how to contribute
3. [ ] Improve the README.md with more examples and use cases
4. [ ] Document the plugin system and how to create custom plugins
5. [ ] Create diagrams explaining the data flow and architecture
6. [ ] Add inline comments explaining complex algorithms
7. [ ] Create a troubleshooting guide for common issues
8. [ ] Document the command-line syntax in more detail
9. [ ] Create a user guide with examples for different scenarios
10. [ ] Add version history and changelog

## Build and Deployment Improvements

1. [ ] Update dependencies to the latest versions
2. [ ] Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
3. [ ] Add static code analysis tools to the build process
4. [ ] Implement code coverage reporting
5. [ ] Create a release process with proper versioning
6. [ ] Add Docker support for containerized deployment
7. [ ] Implement a plugin packaging system for third-party plugins
8. [ ] Add support for building native executables with GraalVM
9. [ ] Implement a proper build system for different platforms
10. [ ] Add performance benchmarks to the build process

## Feature Improvements

1. [ ] Add support for more thread dump formats
2. [ ] Implement a GUI for interactive analysis
3. [ ] Add support for comparing thread dumps from different JVMs
4. [ ] Implement a plugin marketplace for sharing custom plugins
5. [ ] Add support for analyzing memory dumps
6. [ ] Implement a REST API for remote analysis
